Tools for Primitive Root Diffusers

Description
-----------

This project contains methods of calculating the height and placement of wells
(or "blocks") for two-dimensional primitive root diffusers used as acoustic
treatment.

These diffusers (also called "skyline diffusers") are most often constructed
as a grid of wooden blocks with varying heights in a non-repeating pattern to
reduce direct reflections instead of absorbing acoustic energy.
